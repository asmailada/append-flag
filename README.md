 ### Introduction

 It is a tool for ninja build system that modified *.ninja files.
 Allow user to add any cflags for specific source file.
 Using python.

First, you need a json file to indicate the relation between target source files and a  set of cflags as below:
		
```sh		
test.json
			{
			    "src": {
			        "SOURCES": {
			            "ninja.cc": "-Ofast -marm -finline-limit=501",
			            "build.cc": "-Ofast -marm -finline-limit=502"
			        }
			    }
			}
```
### Running Ninja-Modifier

1. Before running Ninja-Modifier while building Chromium Project, notice that you need to run 

`
	gn gen out/Default target
`

to make sure everything is up-to-date.


2. Run Ninja-Modifierâ€¨

`
	python ninja_modifier.py -C chromium/src/ -in test.json
`

`-C`	The working directory for Ninja-Modifier to scan all *.ninja files. This will make a changing for working directory to chromium/src/

`-in`	The input json file. Ninja-Modifier will read this file after changing working directory. Therefore, the file path needed to be relative to -C path.


### Flow
		1. Ninja-Modifier first changing the working directory to `-C` argument.
		2. Read in json file.
		3. Traverse CWD to find all `*.ninja` files and cache the rules, build settings.
		4. According to the description in json file, create specific rules and rewrite the build settings for each source file.

### Notice

**Before using this tool, please run `gn gen out/Default` to checkout all files.**

Due to the machenism of ninja build system in building Chromium OS, running `ninja` will make an automatically update of all *.ninja files while source files had changes, which will cause a rewrite of all *.ninja files if we use this tool without first checkout all files.


### Problems
		1.  More effecient addRule() should be implement. (skip unchange *.ninja files)
		2.  Need to come up with a more organized style.
